# REASTful API
In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential. This project delves into the domain of RESTful APIs, a cornerstone in the realm of web services. The Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, stateless, and cacheable communication system. This approach allows for the easy integration of web services, making them accessible to a wide range of applications.
